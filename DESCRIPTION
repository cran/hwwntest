Description: Provides methods to test whether time series is consistent
	with white noise. Two new tests based on Haar wavelets and general
	wavelets described by Nason and Savchev (2014)
	<doi:10.1002/sta4.69> are provided and, for comparison purposes
	this package also implements the
	B test of Bartlett (1967) <doi:10.2307/2333850>. Functionality
	is provided to compute an approximation to the theoretical
	power of the general wavelet test in the case of general
	ARMA alternatives.
