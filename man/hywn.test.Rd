\title{Hybrid of Box-Ljung test, Bartlett B test, Haar wavelet and
	General wavelet tests.
}
\description{Omnibus test that attempts to mitigate poor performance of
	single test on a particular class where it does poorly by running
	four different tests that work well in different directions and
	pooling their results.
}
\usage{
hywn.test(x, filter.number = 10, family = "DaubExPhase")
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{The data you wish to test (dyadic length)
}
  \item{filter.number}{The number of vanishing moments of the wavelet used.
}
  \item{family}{The family of the wavelets
}
}
\value{A list with components:
\item{p.value}{The overall p-value of the test}
\item{method}{Text string containing the name of the method used}
