1.1:	Bugfix to hwwn.test. p-value now being computed correctly
	from the cdf.

1.2:	Added bartlettB.test and cumperiod: to compute Bartlett's B-test for
	white noise.

	Upgraded compute.rejection. This can now compute empirical power
	for all the new tests you can optionally select or deselect
	the ones you wish to compute. 

	Added d00.test. Similar to hwwn.test but ONLY computes the single
	coarsest scale wavelet coefficient, and tests this for zeroness.
	Reason for this test: the coefficient is computed not from the 
	periodogram, but from the autocorrelation coefficients, showing that
	a wavelet-based test on the periodogram can be computed from
	an equivalent particular linear combination of autocorrelations.

	Added genwwn.test. Similar to hwwn.test except that (i) it computes
	the wavelet coefficients with respect to any wavelet and (ii) only
	looks at the zeroness of coefficients are medium- to coarse scales
	(not the fine scales). For many spectra you'd expect in practice
	this is a good thing because smooth spectra have sparse wavelet
	expansions and almost no signal at finer scales anyway.

	Added genwwn.thpower: Computes approximate theoretical power
	(or size) for the gennwn.test

	Added hywavwn.test: a hybrid test mixing hwwn.test and genwwn.test

	Added hywn.test: a hybrid of Box.test, bartlettB.test, hwwn.test
		and genwwn.test

	Added normwhn2.test: a copy of the whitenoise.test from the
	normwhn package

	Added the squared wavelet transform: sqwd and helper functions. Useful
	for calculating variances of wavelet coefficients

1.3 	Bugfix for the bartlettB.test. Delyan noticed that the periodogram
	should be computed on frequencies 2:q not 1:q, i.e. omitting the DC
	component. Functions bartlettB.test and cumperiod have been modified.

	Changed packages from Depends to Imports

1.3.1	Made new hwwntest-package.Rd document (in response to Kurt Hornik email
	of 18th May 2018). Essentially, this means replacing some content
	with macros so the -package.Rd document stays synced with the
	version numbers.

1.3.2 	Changed email address of maintainer
